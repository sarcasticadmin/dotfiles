# FreeBSD

## Kernel Dump

Set `dumpdev=AUTO` in its `/etc/rc.conf`, and have sufficiently large swap partition, configured at boot time.

### Induce a panic

On FreeBSD, a kernel core file can be generated by intentionally crashing:
```
# sysctl debug.kdb.panic=1
```

### Save

For machines that are configured to enter the on-line kernel debugger (aka kdb), the following command is also needed, at the system console during
a panic:

```
kdb> call doadump
```
> Otherwise, the kernels dump routines will automatically save the core file to a swap partition, if configured.

Upon reboot, the savecore rc startup script will automatically identify the core file in the swap partition, and save it to `/var/crash` by default.
