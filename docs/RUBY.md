## rspec

`rspec` output format is explicitly set by `~/.rspec`. But it can also be defined
in the directory where its being run: https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-8/docs/configuration/read-command-line-configuration-options-from-files

More about the config load order: http://rspec.info/documentation/3.8/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration.html
